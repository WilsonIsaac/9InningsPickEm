This repository is for tracking a personal project script I've been working on, creating a Python Script to aggregate and neatly print out a table (using Reddit formatting) with the following information (for all baseball games being played on a specific date), to help inform Pick Em selections for a given day during the season:
* Away Teams/Home Teams
* Team Records
* Probable Pitchers
* Probable Pithcer ERAs
* Home/Away Win Probabilities
* Weather Data (bolding matchups that have a >35% chance of rain in an outdoor stadium)*
* Home/Away FiveThirtyEight ELOs (allowing win probabilities prior to the start of the game)*

*Items with an asteriks are in-progress (planned for automation, but currently require manual interaction). 

During the offseason, the full scripts may not always function as expected when populating data for regular season games.
