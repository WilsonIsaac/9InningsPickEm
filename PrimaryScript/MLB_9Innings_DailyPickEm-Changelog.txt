v1.0: Initial script


v1.1: Minor formatting and phrasing adjustments 
  **Changes:**
	-Removed the extra words from the last sentence ("the last couple days")
	-Removed the extra line breaks before every "&nbsp;"
	-Added in a missing parentheses (after the Swish link)
	-Altered the Swish link to use their weather URL instead of the general game/linup one 
	-Added in point 3, with info about what an italicized matchup means (for double-headers)
	
  **Backlog:**
	-Set up date parser to auto-select the entered date as the Swish link, for higher accuracy
	-Figure out how to actually italicize matchups that are double headers, and potentially place them right underneath game 1
	-Pull in weather data at the end of the program
	-Auto-pull in winning percentages from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mlb-elo ; could potentially use https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/08/fivethirtyeight-data-in-python.html for a method
